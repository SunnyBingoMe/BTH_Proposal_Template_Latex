Name: BTH Master Thesis Proposal Template for Latex version 3.1
Author: admin@SunnyBoy.me
Version: 2012.02.09.00.54-1.1
Licence: ( It is dedigned for BTH students, 
please conntact me or BTH for detail.) 

Tested in pdfLatex of texWorks v0.5-r1 and lyx2.0.0.
To use this template, you may need to install texWorks or use texLive.

IMPORTANT:

1. For bibtex user:

To use the Bibtex function, you could just get the ciatation in Bibtex format from 
some database such as ieeeXplorer, and past it into "xxx.bib" file.
Then you can cite it withe the key word. See the "citation example" in xxx.tex file.
PS: There may be a slight different betweeen ieeeXplorer's format and 
your latex compiler, for example, the "booktitle" in ieeeXplorer should be "title"
in the xxx.bib file.

The process to use bibtex is:
pdfLatex compile > bibtex compile > pdfLatex compile > pdfLatex compile.
If you get anything wrong, delete all the temp files created by your editor/tools 
and redo the 4 steps.

2. For lyx user:

Please use the exist .lyx file instead of "import from plain latex" feature.
This "BTH Thesis Proposal Template for Latex" is based on the template of MS word, 
which is attached and could be found here: http://bit.ly/tCLNRL .

Thanks bug report from huzh09@student.bth.se , solved a compatible bug due to 
the difference between lyx and texWorks.


Version: 2011.12.30.05.00-1.0b

Known issue: the original word template is using "Arial" font which is in 
"get non free fonts" (http://bit.ly/vAIXVM, not a build-in font of texLive) 
and has some compatibility problem with other tools, so a similar one 
"helvet" is used instead. If you find any bug or possibility to improve it,
please send me an email, thank you.
